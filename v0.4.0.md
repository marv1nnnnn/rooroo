# Rationale for v0.4.0 Architectural Changes

Version 0.4.0 introduces significant **breaking changes** to the `rooroo` orchestration framework, primarily focused on improving the robustness of state management and refining agent responsibilities for greater clarity and efficiency. The core of this change is the transition from a single, complex JSON file (`project_overview.json`) for task management to a line-oriented, append-friendly approach using `task_queue.jsonl` and `task_log.jsonl`.

## 1. From Central JSON to JSONL: Enhancing Robustness and Workflow Smoothness (Breaking Change)

*   **Problem:** The previous architecture (up to v0.3.x) relied on `project_overview.json` as the central hub for all task definitions, statuses, and project-wide configurations. Modifying this complex JSON file, often requiring `apply_diff`-like operations, proved to be brittle and prone to errors, potentially disrupting the workflow. The `Workflow Coordinator` also carried a significant burden in interpreting and updating this central file.
*   **Solution (v0.4.0):** Adopt a JSONL (JSON Lines) format for core operational data:
    *   **`task_queue.jsonl`:** This file now serves as the definitive source for tasks to be executed. Each line is a self-contained JSON object representing a single task. This format allows for simpler, more robust line-based operations (appending new tasks, removing the top task after consumption).
    *   **`task_log.jsonl`:** An append-only file where both the `Workflow Coordinator` and `Strategic Planner` record significant events as structured JSON objects on separate lines. This provides a clear, immutable audit trail.
*   **Why it's Breaking:**
    *   **Retirement of `project_overview.json`:** The central `project_overview.json` file is entirely replaced. Workflows and tools expecting this file will break.
    *   **New Data Formats:** `task_queue.jsonl` and `task_log.jsonl` introduce new structures and interaction patterns.
    *   **State Update Mechanism:** Task management shifts from complex in-place updates of a single JSON document to appending/removing lines in JSONL files.

## 2. Role Realignment: Simplifying Coordinator, Empowering Planner (Breaking Change)

The shift to JSONL files facilitates a significant and beneficial realignment of responsibilities between the `Workflow Coordinator` and the `Strategic Planner`:

*   **`Workflow Coordinator` (Cheaper Model, More Mechanical):**
    *   **Simplified Role:** The Coordinator's primary function becomes more mechanical:
        1.  Triage initial user requests and delegate complex planning/new item integration to the Planner by adding a temporary task to `task_queue.jsonl` for the Planner.
        2.  Consume the top task from `task_queue.jsonl`.
        3.  Log its actions (e.g., `task_delegated`) to `task_log.jsonl`.
        4.  Rewrite `task_queue.jsonl` without the consumed task.
        5.  Delegate the task to the appropriate agent.
        6.  Upon agent completion, read the agent's state file (`.state/tasks/{taskId}.json`).
        7.  Log the completion/failure to `task_log.jsonl`.
        8.  Automatically proceed to the next task in the queue.
    *   **Reduced Complexity:** The Coordinator no longer needs to understand the intricacies of the entire project plan or perform complex modifications to a central state file. It focuses purely on dispatch and logging based on the queue's current head.
*   **`Strategic Planner` (Smarter Model, Full Queue Authority):**
    *   **Expanded Role & Authority:** The Planner becomes the sole authority and manager of `task_queue.jsonl`. Responsibilities include:
        1.  Initial plan creation and populating `task_queue.jsonl`.
        2.  Assigning all final `NNN#type#subject` task IDs, including a robust ID generation strategy based on current queue contents.
        3.  Integrating new work items (from user requests via the Coordinator) or sub-tasks (proposed by other agents via their state files) into `task_queue.jsonl` at appropriate positions based on dependencies and priority.
        4.  Handling error conditions, initiating refinement loops (e.g., by adding refinement tasks to the queue for the `Solution Architect`), and re-queuing or modifying tasks as needed.
        5.  Logging its significant planning actions (e.g., `plan_updated`, `task_integrated_into_queue`) to `task_log.jsonl`.
*   **Why it's Breaking:**
    *   The `Workflow Coordinator`'s logic and interaction with state files are fundamentally altered. It no longer manages a global overview.
    *   The `Strategic Planner` takes on significantly more responsibility for dynamic queue management, which was previously distributed or handled via complex updates to `project_overview.json`.

## 3. Retirement of Project-Wide `project_configuration` in Central File (Breaking Change)

*   **Problem:** The `project_configuration` object, previously stored in `project_overview.json` (v0.3.x), added another layer of complexity to the central file.
*   **Solution (v0.4.0):** With the retirement of `project_overview.json`, the top-level `project_configuration` is also retired in its previous form. If project-specific configurations are needed for tasks, the `Strategic Planner` is expected to embed them directly within the `delegation_details.context` of individual tasks in `task_queue.jsonl` as it defines them.
*   **Why it's Breaking:** Agents or workflows expecting to find a global `project_configuration` object read from a central file will no longer find it. They must now rely on task-specific context provided by the Planner.

These changes in v0.4.0 aim to create a more robust, scalable, and maintainable orchestration system by leveraging simpler file operations and clearly delineating agent responsibilities, especially between the `Workflow Coordinator` and the `Strategic Planner`. The move to JSONL is a key enabler for this improved architecture.
