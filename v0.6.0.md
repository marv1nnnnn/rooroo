# Rationale for v0.6.0 Architectural & Prompting Enhancements

Version 0.6.0 introduces critical refinements to the `rooroo` orchestration framework, including a **breaking change** related to the `Rooroo Navigator`'s direct expert invocation protocol. This version also focuses on incorporating advanced prompting techniques across all agent directives, inspired by recent insights into LLM behavior (such as those discussed in the context of the "leaked Claude Sonnet prompt"). The overall goal is to improve agent instruction clarity, reduce ambiguity, and enhance system reliability and performance.

## 1. Breaking Change: Navigator's Direct Expert Invocation Protocol (Triage E)

A key change in the `.roomodes` configuration for the `Rooroo Navigator` (v9.2) impacts how it directly invokes experts for immediate tasks (Triage E), leading to a breaking change.

*   **Problem Context (Previous Versions e.g., v0.5.10 and earlier Navigator v9.0 in `.roomodes_old`):**
    *   In previous configurations, when the `Rooroo Navigator` initiated a direct task with an expert (e.g., `rooroo-developer`, `rooroo-analyzer`, `rooroo-documenter` via Triage E), the command message for the expert explicitly included the `--context-file` argument.
    *   For example, the message used to be structured like: `COMMAND: EXECUTE_TASK --task-id {DIRECT_EXEC_TASK_ID} --context-file .rooroo/tasks/{DIRECT_EXEC_TASK_ID}/context.md --goal "{refined_goal_for_expert}" ...`
    *   This ensured the expert agent knew the precise location of its `context.md` briefing file.

*   **The Change in Current `.roomodes` (Navigator v9.2 leading to v0.6.0):**
    *   The `customInstructions` for the `Rooroo Navigator` (slug: `rooroo-navigator`, version v9.2) under "Phase 1: Task Triage & Dispatch", section "E. SINGLE EXPERT TASK (Clear, Actionable, Valid Expert)", item 4, describes the delegation as:
        `Delegate: <new_task><mode>{TARGET_EXPERT_MODE}</mode><message>COMMAND: EXECUTE_TASK --task-id {DIRECT_EXEC_TASK_ID} --goal "{refined_goal_for_expert}" ...</message></new_task>`
    *   Notably, the `--context-file ...` argument is **missing** from the command string within the `<message>` tag for this specific Triage E scenario. Other delegation paths (like Triage D for planner, or Phase 2 for queued tasks) in the same Navigator v9.2 directives *do* correctly include the `--context-file` or equivalent path information in the message to the expert/planner.

*   **Impact & Why it's Breaking:**
    *   All Rooroo expert agents (`rooroo-developer`, `rooroo-analyzer`, `rooroo-documenter`) are fundamentally designed to receive their `context.md` file path via the `--context-file` argument in their startup command (as per their own directives, e.g., "Input: `COMMAND: EXECUTE_TASK --task-id {TASK_ID} --context-file ... --goal "..."`").
    *   The omission of this argument in the Navigator's Triage E dispatch means that when an expert is invoked directly for an immediate task, it will not receive the path to its briefing.
    *   This will cause the expert agent to fail during its initialization or execution phase, as it cannot locate or read its essential `context.md` file.
    *   This constitutes a **breaking change** because the communication contract between the Navigator and these experts for the Triage E workflow has been altered in a way that prevents the experts from functioning as designed.

*   **Correction/Adaptation Required:**
    *   For the system to function correctly under this direct invocation scenario, the `Rooroo Navigator`'s Triage E directive (specifically item 4 under "Phase 1: Task Triage & Dispatch" -> "E. SINGLE EXPERT TASK") must be updated to include the `--context-file .rooroo/tasks/{DIRECT_EXEC_TASK_ID}/context.md` (or equivalent dynamic path) parameter within the `<message>` string sent to the expert.
    *   Alternatively, though less consistent with other interactions, expert agents would need a new mechanism to discover their context file path when this argument is missing, but this is not currently defined in their directives.

## 2. Inspired Prompting Enhancements (System-Wide)

Taking inspiration from detailed examples of effective LLM prompting (such as those highlighted in discussions around the "leaked Claude 4 Sonnet prompt" and general best practices for instruction-following models), v0.6.0 emphasizes the application of more sophisticated prompting techniques across all Rooroo agent directives in `.roomodes`.

*   **Focus Areas for Prompting Skill Application:**
    *   **Explicit Role Priming & Persona Definition:** Ensuring each agent's `roleDefinition` and `customInstructions` clearly and consistently establish its persona, capabilities, and limitations to ground the LLM effectively.
    *   **Structured Directives & Clear Action Steps:** Breaking down complex tasks into smaller, numbered, or bulleted steps within `customInstructions`. Using imperative verbs and clear, unambiguous language.
    *   **Emphasis on Critical Principles & Constraints:** Key operational rules (e.g., "Principle of Least Assumption," "Link, Don't Embed," path conventions, output formats) are not just stated once but are often reinforced in relevant sections of the directives to ensure adherence.
    *   **Input/Output Specification:** Providing clear examples or descriptions of expected input formats (e.g., command line arguments like `--task-id`, `--context-file`) and, crucially, the precise structure of output formats (e.g., the JSON structure for "Output Envelopes").
    *   **Internal "Thinking" Encouragement:** While not always explicitly using `<thinking>` tags in all current Rooroo directives, the structure of many instructions implicitly encourages a "chain of thought" or sequential processing by detailing analysis steps before action steps. Future refinements could make this more explicit.
    *   **Handling Ambiguity:** Explicitly instructing agents on how to behave when faced with ambiguity (e.g., the "Principle of Least Assumption" directing agents to ask for clarification rather than guess).
    *   **Use of Examples:** The Navigator v9.2 directives already incorporate examples for user-facing messages. This principle can be extended to other areas where specific formats or behaviors are critical.

*   **Goal of Prompting Enhancements:**
    *   To improve the reliability and predictability of agent behavior.
    *   To reduce instances of misinterpretation of instructions or deviation from established protocols.
    *   To make agents more robust in handling their specified tasks by ensuring they have clear, comprehensive, and well-structured guidance.
    *   To align the operational logic of Rooroo agents more closely with best practices for guiding advanced language models.

## Conclusion

Version 0.6.0 highlights a critical breaking change in the `Rooroo Navigator`'s direct expert invocation protocol that requires immediate attention to restore full system functionality for that workflow. Simultaneously, this version underscores a commitment to leveraging advanced prompting techniques across all agent directives. By refining how agents are instructed, `rooroo` aims to build a more robust, reliable, and intelligent orchestration system. Addressing the breaking change is paramount, after which the ongoing enhancements in prompting will continue to improve the capabilities of the Rooroo agent team.
