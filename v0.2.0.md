# Rationale for v0.2.0 Architectural Changes

Version 0.2.0 introduces significant **breaking changes** and optimizations to the custom mode architecture. These changes were driven by goals to improve efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and streamline workflow orchestration by adopting a **Coordinator-led, signal-driven model with decoupled state reporting**.

## 1. Coordinator-Led Workflow, Triage & Role Refinement (Breaking Change)

*   **Problem:** The previous architecture (`v0.1.x`) involved the `Strategic Planner` as the primary entry point, followed by a `Workflow Coordinator` that relied on direct state updates from specialists and complex handling (including user confirmation loops) for built-in coding tasks. This was inefficient and overly interactive.
*   **Solution (v0.2.0):** Inverted control flow, introduced strict triage, and refined roles:
    *   **`Workflow Coordinator` (Cheap Model):** Elevated to the **Primary Orchestrator & Interface**. Performs strict, rule-based **triage** on initial user requests. If planning/design is needed, delegates to **Smart Model** specialists (`Strategic Planner`, `Solution Architect`). For execution, follows **Planner's `suggested_mode`**, waits for **completion signals**, **reads agent-created state files** (`.state/tasks/{taskId}.json`), validates them, and uses **batch operations** for overview updates.
    *   **`Strategic Planner` (Smart Model):** Refocused as an **on-demand specialist** invoked by Coordinator. Responsibility: goal interpretation, decomposition, populating `project_overview.json` (using `NNN:type:subject` `taskId` format) including `delegation_details` with `suggested_mode`. **Does not create task state files.**
*   **Why it's Breaking:**
    *   **Control Flow Reversal & Triage:** Coordinator is now the entry point.
    *   **Planner Output Dependency:** Coordinator strictly relies on `suggested_mode`.
    *   **State Update Mechanism:** Agents create their own state files (`.state/tasks/*.json`); Coordinator reads these and batch updates the overview (`project_overview.json`). This changes *who* writes *what*, *where*, and *when*.
    *   **Removal of User Confirmation Loop:** Explicit user confirmation for coding task completion (v0.1.2) is replaced by the `coder-monk` reporting its status via its state file.

## 2. Dedicated Coder Monk & Decoupled State (Breaking Change)

*   **Problem:** Directly delegating to built-in IDE modes lacked a consistent mechanism for reporting detailed completion status, outputs, or errors back into the orchestrated workflow state. The previous optimistic assumption or user confirmation loops were suboptimal.
*   **Solution (v0.2.0):** Introduced a dedicated **`coder-monk`** and mandated decoupled state reporting for all executing agents:
    *   **`coder-monk`:** Handles coding/debugging/refactoring tasks delegated by the Coordinator (based on Planner's `suggested_mode`). It executes the task and, as its **final step**, **creates its own state file** (`.state/tasks/{taskId}.json`) reporting its status (`Done`/`Failed`/`Error`), paths of modified files (`output_references`), and logs.
    *   **Decoupled State Reporting:** All executing agents (`coder-monk`, `solution-architect`, `ux-specialist`, `guardian-validator`, `docu-crafter`) follow this pattern: execute task, create artifacts, then **create/write ONLY their own `.state/tasks/{taskId}.json` file** with the final outcome and relevant details (like `planned_subtasks` or `validation_result_for_target`).
    *   **Coordinator Reads State:** The Coordinator waits for the completion signal, then reads the specific `.state/tasks/{taskId}.json` file to get the authoritative result of the task execution.
*   **Why it's Breaking:**
    *   Replaces direct use of built-in modes for coding tasks with a specific agent (`coder-monk`).
    *   Fundamentally changes how task results and status are communicated back to the orchestrator (agents push state to their own file, Coordinator pulls after signal).

## 3. Cost Savings and Resource Optimization (Driving Further Changes)

*   **Problem:** Running expensive LLMs for the procedural Coordinator role is inefficient. Frequent individual state file updates by multiple agents can incur unnecessary API calls.
*   **Solution (v0.2.0):** The architectural changes enable targeted resource use and reduced API calls:
    *   `Workflow Coordinator` (Cheap Model) uses simplified logic (triage, follow `suggested_mode`, wait for signal, read state, batch write), making it suitable for **fast/cheap LLMs**.
    *   `Strategic Planner`, `Solution Architect`, `UX Specialist` remain candidates for **smart/expensive LLMs**.
    *   `Guardian Validator`, `DocuCrafter` are candidates for **cheap/fast LLMs**.
    *   `Coder Monk` model tier can vary based on task complexity.
    *   **Decoupled state updates** (one write per agent per task) and **batch overview updates** (one write by Coordinator per cycle) minimize API interactions compared to previous models.
    *   **Consolidated Artifact Storage:** Outputs are now in `.state/` subdirectories (e.g., `.state/specs/`), referenced from the task state file.
*   **Why it's Breaking:** The pursuit of cost savings drove the fundamental **breaking changes** (role reversal, `coder-monk`, decoupled state reporting via agent-created files, Coordinator reading state, batch updates, consolidated artifacts). These optimizations alter agent interactions, state flow, and update mechanisms.

These modifications in v0.2.0 fundamentally alter the operational flow, agent responsibilities, state management protocol, and expected interactions compared to v0.1.x, necessitating the "breaking change" designation.
